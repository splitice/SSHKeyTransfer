SSHKeyTransfer
==============

Easy way to add a SSH key for password-less login to many servers.

Note
==============
This is old and ugly code, it is being posted simply because it may be useful to someone. No further development by me will be done, feel free to fork.
Binary is available at: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/62365823/ssh-key-transfer/ssh-key-transfer-1.0.rar

Usage
==============
Either:
a) Fill out the form completely
b) Fill out the password and SSH Key sections. Then drag one/many putty shortcuts with an argument of "-ssh user@host" onto the window.
